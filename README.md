# ESPN Fantasy Football Discord Chat Bot

This package creates a docker container that runs a Discord chat bot to send ESPN Fantasy Football information to a Discord chat room.

Main code forked from https://github.com/dtcarls/fantasy_football_chat_bot

**What are the differences from the main repo?**

- Adds an extra method of determining team dominance, Simulated Record, which calculates how many games a given team would have won had they faced each team every week
- Adds a Waiver Report that provides a quick overview of the adds and drops that have taken place on waiver days *[ESPN_S2 and SWID variables are REQUIRED for this functionality]*
- Adds a Monitor Report, which lets players know if they have any players that they might not want to start
- Adds an Inactive Report, which lets players know when they have players that are designated Out, or would otherwise score them 0 points
- Adds the Optimal Scores report, which tabulates how many points each team could have scored, and how much of that score they got
- Adds another possible Environmental Variable, SCORE_WARNING, which is a number that can be set as a threshold for the Monitor Report
- Adds extra places for the fun random phrases that can be activated with the variable RANDOM_PHRASE
- When provided in the Environmental Variables USERS and EMOTES, bot will display them in the scheduled updates
- Custom formatting changes
- Custom forks and changes for my two leagues
- Additional trophies, which will display when the Environmental Variable EXTRA_TROPHIES is set to 1:
  - Week MVP: Player with the highest score differential. Calculated with (actual score - projected score)/projected score
  - Week LVP: Player with the lowest score differential.
  - Overachiever: Team with the highest score over their projected score (actual score - projected score). Awarded when this is different from the highest overall scorer.
  - Underachiever: Team with the lowest score under their projected score. Awarded when this is different from the lowest overall scorer.
  - Plus extra trophies for the end of the season: most moves, highest score, optimal benching, efficiency, best/worst performance, and season MVP/LVP


**What does this do?**
- Sends out the following messages on this schedule:
- Scoreboard - Sun - 16:00, 20:00 east coast time (Current ESPN fantasy scoreboard)
- Scoreboard - Mon,Fri - 7:30 local time (Current ESPN fantasy scoreboard)
- Close Projected Scores - Sun,Mon - 18:30 east coast time (Games that are within 11 points to keep an eye on during the Sunday & Monday night games)
- Final scores and Trophies- Tue - 7:30 local time
- Current standings - Tue - 18:30 local time
- Optimal scores - Tue - 18:30 local time
- Power rankings - Tue - 18:30 local time
- Waiver report - Wed - 7:30 local time (Can be every day with optional setting)
- Monitor report - Wed - 18:30 local time (Players to monitor for possible replacement)
- Matchups - Thu - 18:30 east coast time (Upcoming matchups before Thursday night game)
- Inactive player report - Sun - 12:05 east coast time (Right after inactive reports for the first games on Sunday)

### User and Emote IDs

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

If you're using Discord and would like to go to the effort, you can provide lists of your Discord user and emote IDs in the Environment Variables.

- USERS: List of Discord user IDs, comma separated, in the format of \<@[ID 1 HERE]\> ,\<@[ID 2 HERE]\> ,etc.
- EMOTES: List of Discord emote IDs, comma separated, in the format of \<:[Emote shortcut]:[Emote ID]\> ,\<:[Emote shortcut]:[Emote ID]\> ,etc.

Replace the [ ] and the content within with the IDs.

To get IDs, first enable Developer Mode in Discord's Advanced settings.

For Users, just right click the user in the server list and select "Copy ID". User IDs must go in the order of the teams in the league.

Emotes MUST be from the server-specific list. To get the ID, say '\\:[Emote shortcut]:' in any text channel and copy the text that appears.

Both the Users and Emotes lists need to go in order that the teams joined your league. On your league page, go to League -> Members, which will give you a list of teams in this order. Additionally, each team has a team ID that reflects this order. You can visit each team page to make sure your order is correct. If you have deleted a team in the past, then that number does not get reused and you will need to leave their entry in the list blank, with nothing between the commas. For instance, if Team 2 was deleted your list would look like: "ID1 ,,ID3 ,..."

Make sure to include a space before the comma before each user and emote ID, it's important for formatting messages.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

**League must be full.**

The bot isn't working

* Did you miss a step in the instructions? Try doing it from scratch again. If still no luck, open an issue (https://github.com/dtcarls/fantasy_football_chat_bot/issues) so the answer can be shared with others.

How are power ranks calculated?

* They are calculated using 2 step dominance, as well as a combination of points scored and margin of victory. Weighted 80/15/5 respectively. I wouldn't so much pay attention to the actual number but more of the gap between teams. Full source of the calculations can be seen here: https://github.com/cwendt94/ff-espn-api/commit/61f8a34de5c42196ba0b1552aa25282297f070c5

What fantasy sites do you support?
* ESPN Public
* ESPN Private
* Sleeper (gamedaybot.com)
* Yahoo (gamedaybot.com) (Coming soon)

How do I set another timezone?

* Specify your variable https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List

Is there a version of this for Messenger/WhatsApp/[insert other chat]?

* No, but I am open to pull requests implementing their API for additional cross platform support.

My Standings look wrong. I have weird (+1) in it.

* TOP_HALF_SCORING: If set to True, when standings are posted on Wednesday it will also include top half scoring wins
* Top half wins is being in the top half of your league for points and you receive an additional "win" for it. The number in parenthesis (+1) tells you how many added wins over the season for top half wins.

## Self Hosting, Development, and Testing

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Clone the repo
First and foremost, clone a copy of this repo to your machine:
``` bash 
git clone https://github.com/sdvgallardo/fantasy_football_chat_bot-vS.git ff_bot
```

### With Docker:

To host with Docker, fill in `docker-compose.yml` with your [Environment Variables](#environment-variables). Variables with "" *must* be wrapped in quotes.

If you are running Docker on a Raspberry Pi, you will need to change the Python image in the Dockerfile to `slim-buster`
```bash
cd ff_bot
docker compose up -d
```

#### Restarting Docker
If changes are made to the bot, or you adjust your environment variables, you will need to stop and recompose the container:
```bash
cd ff_bot
docker stop [container name]
docker compose up -d
```


### Without Docker:
You can also directly run just the Python script.

Start by running the install:
```bash
cd ff_bot
python3 setup.py install
```
You may also need to install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Then, export your environment variables and run `ff_bot.py`.

```bash
export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=[enter your Webhook URL]
export LEAGUE_ID=[enter ESPN league ID]
export LEAGUE_YEAR=[enter league year]
cd ff_bot
python3 ff_bot/ff_bot.py
```

### Running the tests

Automated tests for this package are included in the `tests` directory. After installation, you can run these tests by changing the directory to the `ff_bot` directory and running the following:

```python3
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
pytest
```
